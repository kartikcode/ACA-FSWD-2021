# First .md type file.
Just fiddling with the markdown format to see how **bold** and *italic* and headings work.
From here on I will keep track of the first few commands and utilities that I use when I start with git.
###### 1.) cd
cd stands for change directory, pretty self-explanatory.
###### 2.) mkdir
mkdir stands for make directory.
###### 3.) git clone 
cloning a remote repository to your local machine.
###### 4.) git push
pushing the changes back to the remote repository.\
Enough for the first Readme.\
A little change for the sake of branching.\
Nano works fine too.
###### 5.)Client-side
The operations that are performed on the client rather than the server.
###### 6.)Server-side
The operations that are performed on the server.
###### 7.)http
The transfer protocol for communication over the web.
###### 8.)https
A secure version of http.
###### 9.)Framework
It allows you to build upon already written code without much modification, one can focus on application specifics rather than low level details.
###### 10.)Libraries
It provides pre-written fuctions which one can use in any way he/she likes but the complete code has to be written by the user.
